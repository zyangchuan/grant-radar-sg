==================================================

|preview| |pypi| |versions|

- `Client Library Documentation`_
- `Product Documentation`_

The **AlloyDB for PostgreSQL for LangChain** package provides a first class experience for connecting to
AlloyDB instances from the LangChain ecosystem while providing the following benefits:

- **Simplified & Secure Connections**: easily and securely create shared connection pools to connect to Google Cloud databases utilizing IAM for authorization and database authentication without needing to manage SSL certificates, configure firewall rules, or enable authorized networks.
- **Improved performance & Simplified management**: use a single-table schema can lead to faster query execution, especially for large collections.
- **Improved metadata handling**: store metadata in columns instead of JSON, resulting in significant performance improvements.
- **Clear separation**: clearly separate table and extension creation, allowing for distinct permissions and streamlined workflows.
- **Better integration with AlloyDB**: built-in methods to take advantage of AlloyDB's advanced indexing and scalability capabilities.

Quick Start
-----------

In order to use this library, you first need to go through the following
steps:

1. `Select or create a Cloud Platform project.`_
2. `Enable billing for your project.`_
3. `Enable the AlloyDB API.`_
4. `Setup Authentication.`_

.. _Select or create a Cloud Platform project.: https://console.cloud.google.com/project
.. _Enable billing for your project.: https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project#enable_billing_for_a_project
.. _Enable the AlloyDB API.: https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=alloydb.googleapis.com
.. _Setup Authentication.: https://googleapis.dev/python/google-api-core/latest/auth.html

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install this library in a `virtualenv`_ using pip. `virtualenv`_ is a tool to create isolated Python environments. The basic problem it addresses is
one of dependencies and versions, and indirectly permissions.

With `virtualenv`_, it's
possible to install this library without needing system install
permissions, and without clashing with the installed system
dependencies.

.. _`virtualenv`: https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/

Vector Store Usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use a vector store to store embedded data and perform vector search.

.. code-block:: python

   from langchain_google_alloydb_pg import AlloyDBEngine, AlloyDBVectorStore
   from langchain_google_vertexai import VertexAIEmbeddings


   engine = AlloyDBEngine.from_instance("project-id", "region", "my-cluster", "my-instance", "my-database")
   embeddings_service = VertexAIEmbeddings(model_name="textembedding-gecko@003")
   vectorstore = AlloyDBVectorStore.create_sync(
       engine,
       table_name="my-table",
       embedding_service=embeddings_service
   )

Hybrid Search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `AlloyDBVectorStore` supports hybrid search (dense vectors + full text) for more comprehensive and relevant search results.

.. code-block:: python

  from langchain_google_alloydb_pg import HybridSearchConfig, reciprocal_rank_fusion

  vs = AlloyDBVectorStore.create_sync(
      engine=engine,
      table_name=TABLE_NAME,
      embedding_service=embedding,
      hybrid_search_config=HybridSearchConfig(
        fusion_function=reciprocal_rank_fusion
      ),
  )
  hybrid_docs = vector_store.similarity_search("products", k=5)


See the full `Vector Store`_ tutorial.

.. _`Vector Store`: https://github.com/googleapis/langchain-google-alloydb-pg-python/tree/main/docs/vector_store.ipynb


Document Loader Usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use a document loader to load data as LangChain ``Document``\ s.

.. code-block:: python

   from langchain_google_alloydb_pg import AlloyDBEngine, AlloyDBLoader


   engine = AlloyDBEngine.from_instance("project-id", "region", "my-cluster", "my-instance", "my-database")
   loader = AlloyDBLoader.create_sync(
       engine,
       table_name="my-table-name"
   )
   docs = loader.lazy_load()

See the full `Document Loader`_ tutorial.

.. _`Document Loader`: https://github.com/googleapis/langchain-google-alloydb-pg-python/tree/main/docs/document_loader.ipynb

Chat Message History Usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use ``ChatMessageHistory`` to store messages and provide conversation
history to LLMs.

.. code:: python

   from langchain_google_alloydb_pg import AlloyDBChatMessageHistory, AlloyDBEngine


   engine = AlloyDBEngine.from_instance("project-id", "region", "my-cluster", "my-instance", "my-database")
   history = AlloyDBChatMessageHistory.create_sync(
       engine,
       table_name="my-message-store",
       session_id="my-session-id"
   )

See the full `Chat Message History`_ tutorial.

.. _`Chat Message History`: https://github.com/googleapis/langchain-google-alloydb-pg-python/tree/main/docs/chat_message_history.ipynb

Langgraph Checkpoint Usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use ``AlloyDBSaver`` to save snapshots of the graph state at a given point in time.

.. code:: python

   from langchain_google_alloydb_pg import AlloyDBSaver, AlloyDBEngine


   engine = AlloyDBEngine.from_instance("project-id", "region", "my-cluster", "my-instance", "my-database")
   checkpoint = AlloyDBSaver.create_sync(engine)

See the full `Checkpoint`_ tutorial.

.. _`Checkpoint`: https://github.com/googleapis/langchain-google-alloydb-pg-python/tree/main/docs/langgraph_checkpoint.ipynb

Example Usage
-------------

Code examples can be found in the `samples/`_ folder.

.. _samples/: https://github.com/googleapis/langchain-google-alloydb-pg-python/tree/main/samples

Converting between Sync & Async Usage
-------------------------------------

Async functionality improves the speed and efficiency of database connections through concurrency,
which is key for providing enterprise quality performance and scaling in GenAI applications. This
package uses a native async Postgres driver, `asyncpg`_, to optimize Python's async functionality.

LangChain supports `async programming`_, since LLM based application utilize many I/O-bound operations,
such as making API calls to language models, databases, or other services. All components should provide
both async and sync versions of all methods.

`asyncio`_ is a Python library used for concurrent programming and is used as the foundation for multiple
Python asynchronous frameworks. asyncio uses `async` / `await` syntax to achieve concurrency for
non-blocking I/O-bound tasks using one thread with cooperative multitasking instead of multi-threading.

.. _`async programming`: https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/async/
.. _`asyncio`: https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html
.. _`asyncpg`: https://github.com/MagicStack/asyncpg

Converting Sync to Async
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Update sync methods to `await` async methods

.. code:: python

   engine = await AlloyDBEngine.afrom_instance("project-id", "region", "my-cluster", "my-instance", "my-database")
   await engine.ainit_vectorstore_table(table_name="my-table", vector_size=768)
   vectorstore = await AlloyDBVectorStore.create(
      engine,
      table_name="my-table",
      embedding_service=VertexAIEmbeddings(model_name="textembedding-gecko@003")
   )

Run the code: notebooks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

ipython and jupyter notebooks support the use of the `await` keyword without any additional setup

Run the code: FastAPI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Update routes to use `async def`.

.. code:: python

   @app.get("/invoke/")
   async def invoke(query: str):
      return await retriever.ainvoke(query)


Run the code: Local python file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is recommend to create a top-level async method definition: `async def` to wrap multiple async methods.
Then use `asyncio.run()` to run the the top-level entrypoint, e.g. "main()"

.. code:: python

   async def main():
      response = await retriever.ainvoke(query)
      print(response)

   asyncio.run(main())
